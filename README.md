# Ed Forth's Candy Land Simulator

Fully implements the 2004 ruleset, with the exception of the "easy" mode.

Old project - adding to github

Not exactly sure where it is, should fully implement the ruleset, want to add an option for the optional ruleset (never moving backwards)

Would be nice to add an ability to run multiple games and store data for those looking to do mathematical analysis.

Moved to an object-oriented structure and cleaned up.
